# Contributing to Studio Admin

Thanks for showing interest in improving **Studio Admin** (repo: `next-shadcn-admin-dashboard`).  
This guide will help you set up your environment and understand how to contribute.

---

## Overview

This project is built with **Next.js 15**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS v4**, and **Shadcn UI**.  
The goal is to keep the codebase modular, scalable, and easy to extend.

---

## Project Layout

We use a **colocation-based file system**. Each feature keeps its own pages, components, and logic.

```
src
â”œâ”€â”€ app               # Next.js routes (App Router)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ (auth)        # Auth layouts & screens
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ (main)        # Main dashboard routes
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ (dashboard)
â”‚   â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ crm
â”‚   â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ finance
â”‚   â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ default
â”‚   â”‚       â””â”€â”€ ...
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ layout.tsx
â”œâ”€â”€ components        # Shared UI components
â”œâ”€â”€ hooks             # Reusable hooks
â”œâ”€â”€ lib               # Config & utilities
â”œâ”€â”€ styles            # Tailwind / theme setup
â””â”€â”€ types             # TypeScript definitions
```
